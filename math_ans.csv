"A bag contains 8 balls, whose colours are either white or black. 4 balls are drawn at random without
replacement and it was found that 2 balls are white and other 2 balls are black. The probability that the bag
contains equal number of white and black balls is:",0.285,Not enough information,0.9,0.0,0.9
"Let Ajay will not appear in JEE exam with probability p=(2/7) , while both Ajay and Vijay will appear in the
exam with probability q=(1/5) . Then the probability, that Ajay will appear in the exam and Vijay will not appear
is :",0.514,(1/5) - (2/35),0.87,0.94,0.06999999999999995
"A fair die is tossed repeatedly until a six is obtained. Let X denote the number of tosses required and let a=P(X=3), b = P(X>=3) and c = P( X>=6 | X>3 ). Then (b+a)/a is equal to_____",12.0,"4/a, given X follows a geometric distribution with success probability 1/6 for each toss.",0.0,0.85,0.85
"An urn contains 6 white and 9 black balls. Two successive draws of 4 balls are made without replacement. The
probability, that the first draw gives all white balls and the second draw gives all black balls, is :",0.004,"Zero probability.

This is because there are only 6 white balls in the urn, and the first draw is for 4 balls. Therefore, it's impossible to draw all white balls in the first draw, making the probability zero.",0.9,0.95,0.04999999999999993
"A fair die is thrown until 2 appears. Then the probability, that 2 appears in even number of throws , is",0.454,"Not enough information.

The question involves probability and a random process, but it doesn't provide enough information about the sequence of die rolls for a precise answer. In order to calculate the probability, we would need to know the specific rules or conditions governing the sequence of rolls after the first 2 appears.",0.7,0.95,0.25
"An integer is chosen at random from the integers 1, 2, 3, ..., 50. The probability that the chosen integer is a
multiple of atleast one of 4, 6 and 7 is",0.42,Not enough information,0.8,0.2,0.6000000000000001
"Two integers x and y are chosen with replacement from the set {0, 1, 2, 3,Â….., 10} . Then the probability that
|x-y| >5 is :",0.248,"Not enough information.

The question lacks sufficient information to provide an accurate answer. The probability of the absolute difference between two integers drawn with replacement from a given set exceeding a certain value cannot be determined without additional information about the distribution or selection process.",0.7,0.9,0.20000000000000007
"Bag A contains 3 white, 7 red balls and bag B contains 3 white, 2 red balls. One bag is selected at random and
a ball is drawn from it. The probability of drawing the ball from the bag A , if the ball drawn in white, is :",0.33,Probability cannot be determined with the given information. The color of the ball drawn doesn't provide sufficient information to determine which bag it came from.,0.0,0.9,0.9
"Two marbles are drawn in succession from a box containing 10 red, 30 white, 20 blue and 15 orange marbles,
with replacement being made after each drawing. Then the probability, that first drawn marble is red and
second drawn marble is white, is",0.053,Product of probabilities: 10/100 * 30/100.,1.0,1.0,0.0
"Three rotten apples are accidently mixed with fifteen good apples. Assuming the random variable x to be the
number of rotten apples in a draw of two apples, the variance of x is",0.261,Not enough information,0.8,0.25,0.55
"A coin is based so that a head is twice as likely to occur as a tail. If the coin is tossed 3 times, then the
probability of getting two tails and one head is-",0.22,"Not enough information.

The question lacks sufficient data about the coin's bias, which is required to calculate the probability.",0.65,0.95,0.29999999999999993
