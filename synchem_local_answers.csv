"Calculate the initial rate (mol$\cdot$L$^{-1}\cdot$s$^{-1}$) of cis-to-trans isomerization for a photoactivatable azobenzene derivative with quantum yield $\phi = 0.42$ under $650$ nm illumination with photon flux $1.5 \times 10^{16}$ photons$\cdot$s$^{-1}\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ in a $1$ mL solution contained in a $1$ cm$^{2}$ cuvette (pathlength $1$ cm) at initial concentration $5~\mu$M. Assume that 100% of the incident photons are absorbed by the solution (i.e., no transmission). Use Avogadro’s number $N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23}$ mol$^{-1}$.",Not enough information,"The question lacks sufficient data to determine the rate of cis-to-trans isomerization, as it does not provide information on the reaction mechanism, activation energy, or other necessary parameters."
"A near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore conjugated to a supramolecular assembly inside endosomes has quantum yield $\phi = 0.15$ and fluorescence lifetime $\tau = 3.8$ ns. Upon photochemical endosomal escape, the local viscosity decreases and the fluorescence lifetime increases by 40%. Assuming the radiative decay rate constant $k_r$ remains unchanged and the change in lifetime results solely from a change in the non-radiative decay rate constant $k_{nr}$, calculate the radiative decay rate constant $k_r$ (s$^{-1}$) **after** endosomal escape.",$\boxed{6.7 \times 10^{6} s^{-1}}$,"Given the initial fluorescence lifetime τ = 3.8 ns, and the increase in lifetime by 40% due to endosomal escape, we can calculate k_r using the formula τ = 1 / (k_r + k_nr). Assuming k_r remains constant and only k_nr changes by a factor of 1.4, we can solve for k_r: 3.8 ns = 1 / (k_r + (1.4)(k_r)), which simplifies to 3.8 ns = 1 / (2.4k_r). Rearranging and solving for k_r gives us k_r = 6.7 × 10^6 s^-1."
"During photochemical control of intracellular assembly, the photoinduced rate constant $k_{\mathrm{photo}}$ follows first-order kinetics and depends on photon flux $I$ (photons$\cdot$cm$^{-2}\cdot$s$^{-1}$) as $k_{\mathrm{photo}} = \sigma I$, where $\sigma$ is the absorption cross-section. Given $\sigma = 2.5 \times 10^{-17}$ cm$^{2}$ and a target $k_{\mathrm{photo}} = 0.01$ s$^{-1}$ under $700$ nm illumination, calculate the required light intensity $I_{\mathrm{W}}$ in W$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$. Use Planck’s constant $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J$\cdot$s and speed of light $c = 3.00 \times 10^{8}$ m$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. Show all steps starting from determining the photon flux $I$.",0.0004 W/cm²,"First, determine the energy of one photon with wavelength λ = 700 nm using E = hc/λ. Then, calculate the number of photons per unit time (I) with I = Nc, where N is the number of photons per second. Finally, use kphoto = σI to find required light intensity I_W in W/cm², where kphoto and σ are given values."
"A dendritic polymer bearing eight peripheral photo-cleavable o-nitrobenzyl ester groups is dissolved at $0.5$ mM in $1$ mL solution (pathlength $1$ cm), which is continuously illuminated at $365$ nm with intensity $10$ mW$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ for $5$ minutes. Given molar extinction coefficient $\varepsilon = 4.5 \times 10^{3}$ L$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$cm$^{-1}$ and quantum yield of cleavage $\phi = 0.25$, calculate the concentration (mol$\cdot$L$^{-1}$) of cleaved ester groups produced, assuming all photons absorbed contribute to cleavage and uniform illumination across the cuvette cross-section. The polymer contains eight cleavable groups per molecule.",2.8 × 10^(-4) mol/L,"Calculate the number of photons absorbed, then apply the quantum yield to find the concentration of cleaved ester groups. The number of photons is given by ε * I * t * A, where I is intensity, t is time (in seconds), and A is pathlength. Convert the energy to moles using Avogadro's constant (6.022 × 10^23 molecules/mol)."
"A supramolecular intracellular assembly shows sigmoidal kinetics characterized by two activation free energy barriers at $310$ K: nucleation barrier $\Delta G^\ddagger_{\mathrm{nucleation}} = 75$ kJ$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$ and elongation barrier $\Delta G^\ddagger_{\mathrm{elongation}} = 40$ kJ$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$. Given the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor for nucleation $A_{\mathrm{nucleation}}$ is 100 times larger than that for elongation $A_{\mathrm{elongation}}$, calculate the ratio of their rate constants $k_{\mathrm{nucleation}}/k_{\mathrm{elongation}}$ at $310$ K. Use the gas constant $R = 8.314$ J$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$.",$\boxed{20}$,"To calculate the ratio of rate constants $k_{\mathrm{nucleation}}/k_{\mathrm{elongation}}$, we use the Arrhenius equation, which states that the rate constant is proportional to the pre-exponential factor (A) times an exponential function of temperature and activation energy ($\Delta G^\ddagger$). Given $\frac{k_{\mathrm{nucleation}}}{k_{\mathrm{elongation}}} = \sqrt{\frac{A_{\mathrm{nucleation}}}{A_{\mathrm{elongation}}}}e^{\left(\frac{\Delta G^\ddagger_{\mathrm{nucleation}} - \Delta G^\ddagger_{\mathrm{elongation}}}{R}\right)}$, we plug in the given values and solve for the ratio."

Using $R = 8.314$ J$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$, first calculate $\Delta G$ and then the equilibrium molar ratio of the assembly concentration in the cytosol relative to the endosome.",-RTln(Kp),"To calculate the Gibbs free energy change ΔG, we use the equation ΔG = -RT ln(Kp), where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K) and Kp is the partition coefficient (125). Plugging in the values, we get ΔG = -(8.314 J/mol·K)(310 K)ln(125) ≈ -34.6 kJ/mol."

Incident light intensity is $2 \times 10^{15}$ photons$\cdot$s$^{-1}\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ over a $0.5$ cm$^{2}$ cross-sectional area. Calculate the fraction of incident photons absorbed by the solution, assuming Beer–Lambert law applies and uniform illumination.",1.8 × 10^(-4),"Calculate the path length (cm) of the cuvette (l = 1 cm), and the cross-sectional area (A = 0.5 cm²). Apply Beer-Lambert law to calculate absorbance (A = εcl): A = 5000 L·mol⁻¹·cm⁻¹ × 10 μM × 1 cm / 0.5 cm² ≈ 50. Then, use the Beer-Lambert law relationship between absorbance and fractional absorption: Fractional Absorption = e^(-A) ≈ 1.8 × 10^(-4)."
"A synthetic intracellular assembly formed from peptide amphiphiles has a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of $15~\mu$M at $37^\circ$C. After covalent attachment of a photo-cleavable group, the CMC increases to $45~\mu$M. Define the change in standard Gibbs free energy of micellization as $\Delta \Delta G^\circ = \Delta G^\circ_{\mathrm{modified}} - \Delta G^\circ_{\mathrm{original}}$. Calculate $\Delta \Delta G^\circ$ (kJ$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$) at $310$ K, assuming ideal solution behavior and using $R = 8.314$ J$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$.",-10.6,"The change in standard Gibbs free energy of micellization is determined by the difference in CMC values before and after photo-cleavage, taking into account temperature. Since CMC is related to $\Delta G^\circ$ via the equation $CMC = (RT/\pi M) \exp(-\Delta G^\circ / RT)$, where $M$ is molecular weight, the ratio of modified to original CMC values can be used to estimate $\Delta \Delta G^\circ$. With a higher CMC indicating less favorable micellization, and assuming ideal behavior, the increase in CMC after photo-cleavage suggests that $\Delta \Delta G^\circ_{\mathrm{modified}} < 0$ and $|\Delta \Delta G^\circ| = kT \ln(C_{\mathrm{modified}}/C_{\mathrm{original}})$. Solving for $\Delta \Delta G^\circ$, we use the given CMC values to estimate a decrease in standard Gibbs free energy of micellization."
