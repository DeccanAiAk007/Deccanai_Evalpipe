"Calculate the initial rate (mol$\cdot$L$^{-1}\cdot$s$^{-1}$) of cis-to-trans isomerization for a photoactivatable azobenzene derivative with quantum yield $\phi = 0.42$ under $650$ nm illumination with photon flux $1.5 \times 10^{16}$ photons$\cdot$s$^{-1}\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ in a $1$ mL solution contained in a $1$ cm$^{2}$ cuvette (pathlength $1$ cm) at initial concentration $5~\mu$M. Assume that 100% of the incident photons are absorbed by the solution (i.e., no transmission). Use Avogadro’s number $N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23}$ mol$^{-1}$."
"A near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore conjugated to a supramolecular assembly inside endosomes has quantum yield $\phi = 0.15$ and fluorescence lifetime $\tau = 3.8$ ns. Upon photochemical endosomal escape, the local viscosity decreases and the fluorescence lifetime increases by 40%. Assuming the radiative decay rate constant $k_r$ remains unchanged and the change in lifetime results solely from a change in the non-radiative decay rate constant $k_{nr}$, calculate the radiative decay rate constant $k_r$ (s$^{-1}$) **after** endosomal escape."
"During photochemical control of intracellular assembly, the photoinduced rate constant $k_{\mathrm{photo}}$ follows first-order kinetics and depends on photon flux $I$ (photons$\cdot$cm$^{-2}\cdot$s$^{-1}$) as $k_{\mathrm{photo}} = \sigma I$, where $\sigma$ is the absorption cross-section. Given $\sigma = 2.5 \times 10^{-17}$ cm$^{2}$ and a target $k_{\mathrm{photo}} = 0.01$ s$^{-1}$ under $700$ nm illumination, calculate the required light intensity $I_{\mathrm{W}}$ in W$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$. Use Planck’s constant $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J$\cdot$s and speed of light $c = 3.00 \times 10^{8}$ m$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. Show all steps starting from determining the photon flux $I$."
"A dendritic polymer bearing eight peripheral photo-cleavable o-nitrobenzyl ester groups is dissolved at $0.5$ mM in $1$ mL solution (pathlength $1$ cm), which is continuously illuminated at $365$ nm with intensity $10$ mW$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ for $5$ minutes. Given molar extinction coefficient $\varepsilon = 4.5 \times 10^{3}$ L$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$cm$^{-1}$ and quantum yield of cleavage $\phi = 0.25$, calculate the concentration (mol$\cdot$L$^{-1}$) of cleaved ester groups produced, assuming all photons absorbed contribute to cleavage and uniform illumination across the cuvette cross-section. The polymer contains eight cleavable groups per molecule."
"A supramolecular intracellular assembly shows sigmoidal kinetics characterized by two activation free energy barriers at $310$ K: nucleation barrier $\Delta G^\ddagger_{\mathrm{nucleation}} = 75$ kJ$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$ and elongation barrier $\Delta G^\ddagger_{\mathrm{elongation}} = 40$ kJ$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$. Given the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor for nucleation $A_{\mathrm{nucleation}}$ is 100 times larger than that for elongation $A_{\mathrm{elongation}}$, calculate the ratio of their rate constants $k_{\mathrm{nucleation}}/k_{\mathrm{elongation}}$ at $310$ K. Use the gas constant $R = 8.314$ J$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$."
"Calculate the Gibbs free energy change $\Delta G$ (kJ$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$) for the partitioning of a synthetic assembly from the endosome to the cytosol at physiological temperature $310$ K, given a partition coefficient $K_p = 125$ (cytosol/endosome). Using $R = 8.314$ J$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$, first calculate $\Delta G$ and then the equilibrium molar ratio of the assembly concentration in the cytosol relative to the endosome."
"Upon NIR irradiation at 800 nm, a photoactivatable supramolecular monomer is illuminated in a $1$ cm pathlength cuvette with monomer concentration $10~\mu$M and molar absorptivity $\varepsilon = 5{,}000$ L$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$cm$^{-1}$. Incident light intensity is $2 \times 10^{15}$ photons$\cdot$s$^{-1}\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ over a $0.5$ cm$^{2}$ cross-sectional area. Calculate the fraction of incident photons absorbed by the solution, assuming Beer–Lambert law applies and uniform illumination."
"A synthetic intracellular assembly formed from peptide amphiphiles has a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of $15~\mu$M at $37^\circ$C. After covalent attachment of a photo-cleavable group, the CMC increases to $45~\mu$M. Define the change in standard Gibbs free energy of micellization as $\Delta \Delta G^\circ = \Delta G^\circ_{\mathrm{modified}} - \Delta G^\circ_{\mathrm{original}}$. Calculate $\Delta \Delta G^\circ$ (kJ$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$) at $310$ K, assuming ideal solution behavior and using $R = 8.314$ J$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$."
"During intracellular supramolecular assembly, a light-triggered radical generation mechanism produces a steady-state radical concentration $[\mathrm{R}^\bullet]$ described by  
\[
[\mathrm{R}^\bullet] = \sqrt{\frac{I \phi \varepsilon C}{k_d}},
\]  
where photon intensity $I = 1.2 \times 10^{17}$ photons$\cdot$s$^{-1}\cdot$cm$^{-2}$, quantum yield $\phi = 0.3$, molar absorptivity $\varepsilon = 10^{4}$ L$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$cm$^{-1}$, monomer concentration $C = 100~\mu$M, and radical decay rate constant $k_d = 1 \times 10^{6}$ s$^{-1}$. Calculate the steady-state radical concentration $[\mathrm{R}^\bullet]$ in mol$\cdot$L$^{-1}$."
